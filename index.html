<!-- Intro to HTML & CSS I

  Module Project Overview

    You will build a website to display the bio of your favorite programmer, artist, etc.

    In order to do this, you will create an `index.html` file and scaffold the document
    with the elements shared by all HTML documents:

    - doctype declaration
    - html element
    - head, containing a title and an optional style tag
    - body, containing the markup that renders to the screen

  Requirements

    Review this article: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp

    Create an `index.html` file for your site, or use this same file.

    For your site, you will make use of at least the following semantic elements:

    - header (to contain the main heading of the site, and the nav)
    - nav (to contain some links to navigate to the different sections of this document)
    - section (each holding at least a heading and a paragraph)
    - aside (containing an img and a caption)
    - footer (containing a contact form)
    - form (containing at least two inputs with their labels)

    See an example of a finished site: https://bloominstituteoftechnology.github.io/img/anita-borg-bio-website.png

    The example above is quite simple, but you can make your site as fancy as you'd like. -->

    <h2>My Father - My Role Model</h2>
    <h3>Date: Oct. 11, 5000 B.C</h3>
    <p>I've always had a hard time living up to my father's name. He was always looked up to
      in our side of the world. It's a shame what happened to him... <br> My uncle was someone
      who was always a very jealous person. Given that my father was successful, and that everyone
      looked up to him - it always really seemed to annoy my uncle. I guess he eventually found
      an opening to finally enact his plan. His plan to assassinate my father. <br><br> It's crazy what
      jealousy will do to some people. I thought my uncle was always quite cool but it looks like
      he had other plans. They were alone together one day and they must have gotten into an 
      argument because at one point in time my father found himself hanging off the edge of a cliff!
      He was holding on for dear life, pleading with my uncle wondering why is it taking him so long
      to come over here and save me? It turns out this is what my uncled had planned anyways - so
      he went up to my father, stepped on his hand and said the words 'Long live the king.'

    <h2>Help us take him down!</h2>
    <p>This man has been causing chaos ever since murdering my father and becoming our 'leader'
      But he is no leader. He is a snake, a murderer, evil and deceptive. Anyone who falls for his 
      tricks are unfortunately being deceived. He is starving our population and exiling anyone 
      who disagrees with his philosophy.
