Hello, this is simply a repo done for bloomtech.
The purpose is to become more familiar with the git workflow and committing, pushing, and making changes to any repos.
This is one of the first projects I did, I will over time make changes to it possibly as I think it is very stupid but can be used as a good way to test some of my knowledge of web development.
Otherwise this whole project is absurdly ugly, and not meant to look absolutely stunning - this is really only meant for me. :)
